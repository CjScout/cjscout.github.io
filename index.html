            <p>Hi, I'm Connor Schuler. I'm a high school student and I spend more time than I'd care to admit in front of a computer. While I enjoy all aspects of computers, my favorites include video editing, programming, and IT work.
            <br><br>
            During my middle school years, I participated in the <strong>Parent Teacher Association Reflections Art Contest</strong>. Each year I animated or recorded and edited a video about the provided topic. My first project made it to second place at the state level, and after that, I doubled down and received State First Place and National Honorable Mentions for my next two works.
            <br><br>
                I consider programming how I got interested in computers in the first place. As far back as elementary school, you could find me working on some form of block-based coding, such as my projects on <strong><a href=”https://scratch.mit.edu”>Scratch</a></strong>. However, my first real experience in coding was in 2017 when my parents signed me up for a Java-based Minecraft modding summer course. Through their other programming courses, I learned basic Python and Unity/C# skills. I also self-taught myself HTML/CSS, and I custom-built this site.
            <br><br>
                Through my Computer Information Systems class in high school, I was able to get the <strong>ITF Pro</strong>, <strong>PC Pro</strong>, and <strong>Linux Pro</strong> certifications. These are certifications through <strong><a href="https://testout.com">testout.com</a></strong> based on relevant CompTIA certifications, which I am also currently working towards. During my second year in the program, I began learning computer networking, and plan to pursue my Cisco CCNA. At the end of the year, I was awarded the Outstanding Student award for my commitment to the program. My crown achievement in the program is the network upgrades I organized. With help from my teacher and fellow students, I designed, budgeted, and implemented a complete network overhaul with VLANS, Layer 3 Routing, ACLs, Active Directory Domain Services, and a lot more.
            <br><br>
            Outside of computers, I am very active at school and in my community. I am the Fundraising Coordinator for my grade's Class Office and have helped plan and execute multiple events such as dances and bingo nights for seniors. I am also a member of my local Boy Scout Troop, where I earned the rank of Eagle Scout. After I turned 18, I transitioned to adult leadership and have continued my involvement with the troop. I've also volunteered at numerous community organizations and events, including ice cream socials, and the Teen Input Board at my local library.
            <br><br>
            I also recently launched my Senior Capstone Project. Tech Bytes is a podcast hosted by me, where I dive into and explain all the latest technological developments in consumer-friendly ways. For all the details of that particular project, head over to the website linked in the navigation bar.</p>
