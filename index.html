I'm a sophmore at in high school and I spend more time than I'd care to admit infront of a computer. While I enjoy all aspects of computers, my favorites include video editing, programming, and IT work.<br><br>During my middle school years, I participated in the Parent Teacher Assosiation's Reflections Art Contest. Each year I animated or recorded and edited a video about the provided top. My first project made it to second place in the state level, and after that I doubled down and recieved State First Place and National Honorable Mentions for my next two works.<br><br>I consider programming how I really got interested in computers in the first place. As far back as elementry school, you could find me working on some form of block based coding, such as my projects on scratch.mit.edu. However, my first real experience in coding as in 2017 when my parents signed me up for a java based minecraft modding summer course. Through their other programming courses, I learned basic python and Unity/C# skills. I also self taught myself HTML/CSS, in fact, I custom wrote this entire site.<br><br>Through my Computer Information Systems class in highschool, I was able to get the ITF Pro certification. ITF Pro is a certification through testout.com based on CompTIA IT Fundamentals, which I am also currently working torwards. I am also working on my PC Pro and Linux Pro certifications, which are again based on CompTIA certifications that I hope to get. With all the coomputer parts available in the room, I also helped build and deploy a new server that runs our website, professoreno.com, includng port-forwarding and DNS records. I also configured a RAID 10 local network share on the server, for faster access to commonly used files such as ISOs and installers.<br><br></p>
