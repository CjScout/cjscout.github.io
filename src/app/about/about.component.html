                    <p>Hi, I'm Connor Schuler. I'm a high school student and I spend more time than I'd care to admit in front of a computer. While I enjoy all aspects of computers, my favorites include video editing, programming, and IT work.</p>

                    <p>During my middle school years, I participated in the <strong pTooltip="Each year, the National PTA invites students to create and submit original works of art in the areas of: Dance Choreography, Film Production, Literature, Music Composition, Photography and Visual Arts.">Parent Teacher Association Reflections Art Contest</strong>. Each year I animated or recorded and edited a video about the provided topic. My first project made it to second place at the state level, and after that, I doubled down and received State First Place and National Honorable Mentions for my next two works.</p>

                    <p>I consider programming how I got interested in computers in the first place. As far back as elementary school, you could find me working on some form of block-based coding, such as my projects on <strong pTooltip="">Scratch</strong>. However, my first real experience in coding was in 2017 when my parents signed me up for a Java based Minecraft modding summer course. Through their other programming courses, I learned basic Python and Unity/C# skills. I also self-taught myself HTML/CSS, and I custom-built this site using the Angular framework.</p>

                    <p>Through my Computer Information Systems class in high school, I was able to get the <strong pTooltip="Demonstrated general IT knowledge.">ITF Pro</strong>, <strong pTooltip="Demonstrated knowledge of Windows and Mac systems.">PC Pro</strong>, and <strong pTooltip="Demonstrated knowledge the Linux command line.">Linux Pro</strong> certifications. These are certifications through testout.com based on relevant CompTIA certifications, which I am also currently working towards. During my second year in the program, I began learning computer networking, and plan to pursure my Cisco CCNA. At the end of the year, I was awarded the Outstanding Student award for my commitment to the program. With all the computer parts available in the room, I also helped build and deploy (including port-forwarding and DNS records) a new server that runs our website. I also configured a RAID 10 local network share on the server, for faster access to commonly used files such as ISOs and installers, as well as a PXE server for faster computer re-imaging.</p>

                    <p>Outside of computers, I am very active at school and in my community. I am the Fundraising Coordinator for my grade's Class Office and have helped planned and execute multiple events such as dances and bingo nights for seniors. I am also a member of my local Boy Scout Troop, where I am a Patrol Leader and currently awaiting my final board of review for the rank of Eagle Scout. I've also volunteered at numerous community organizations and events, including ice cream socials, and the Teen Input Board at my local library.</p>
