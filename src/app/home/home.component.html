    <p>Hello there!<br>
    General Kenobi, you are a bold one. Kill him!<br>
    Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.<br>
    Your move.<br>
    You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku. Attack, Kenobi.<br>
    Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.<br>
    Oh I don't think so.</p>
    <p>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>
    Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>
    Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>
    One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>
    In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>
    One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>
    One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br>
    In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</p>
