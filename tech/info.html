            <p class="para">Ever been working at your computer, and have something go wrong? You could google it, but that requires going through the results to find your specific problem that may or may not exist. Then you need to follow instruction on a random sketchy website that or may not work. You could call the company you bought the computer from, but they'd make you jump through several hoops just to get on the phone with someone. Even then, they'd make you go through a list of things that you probably already tried.
                <br><br>Or what if you want to learn this new piece of software you heard about, but you have no idea where to start. You could find a random guide on the internet, but that could be out of date or difficult to understand. Or what if an update entirely changed what you were used to.
                <br><br>Now, what if someone not bound by corporate requirements, and atually knew what they were doing offered to help?
                <br><br>That is what I provide. I hold a number of industry certifications that involve troubleshooting skills (see my full profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-schuler-b085b627a">here</a> on Linkedin), and I also have extensive experience troubleshooting all manner of problems. For a small fee, you will get my undivided attention for one hour. During that time, I will attempt to help solve any problems, guide you through software, or just answer general questions you may have. Whether your computer won't turn on, you deleted a file by accident, or you just don't understand something, I am able and willing to help.<br><br><br>To schedule an appointment, please see the calendar to the right (or below if you are using a phone) or go to <a href="https://calendly.com/cschulertech/1hr">https://calendly.com/cschulertech/1hr</a></p>
