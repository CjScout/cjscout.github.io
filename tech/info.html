            <p class="para"><strong>COMING SOON </strong>Ever been working at your computer, and have something go wrong? You could google it, but that requires going through the results to find your specific problem that may or may not exist. Then you need to follow instruction on a random sketchy website that or may not work. You could call the company you bought the computer from, but they'd make you jump through several hoops just to get on the phone with someone. Even then, they'd make you go through a list of things that you probably already tried.<br><br>Or what if you want to learn this new piece of software you heard about, but you have no idea where to start. You could find a random guide on the internet, but that could be out of date or difficult to understand. Or what if an update entirely changed what you were used to.<br><br>Now, what if someone not bound by corporate requirements, and atually knew what they were doing offered to help?<br><br>That is what I provide. For a small fee, you will get my undivided attention for one hour. During that time, I will try my hardest to solve any problems, guide you through software, or just answer general questions you may have.</p>
